## What kind of website does my business need?

If you're reading this you probably realized that your business needs a website. Whether it's to reach all potential customers, or to strengthen your brand, a website is required for any serious business.

The next step is to figure out whether you should build and host your website or hire a professional.

If you choose to work with a professional web design agency you should expect the following:

- A professionally designed website
- Search engine optimized and persuasive website content.
- A quick website that loads as fast as possible.

Most of all, you should benefit from **offloading the stress of web development to a professional,** so you can focus on your business.

While those benefits might sound nice, whether or not you receive them depends on you picking the right website development company. This blog post will break down the pricing, designs, and page speed of several Toronto-based web design agencies so you can make the right choice for your business.

**Legend:** Cost ðŸ’° | Design ðŸŽ¨ | Speed âš¡

### Pixelcarve

Pixelcarve is the right choice for a business that needs a unique design and is willing to cough up good money for it. Some appropriate clients include high-end services and sellers who aren't looking for a website to rank high on Google but instead want one that conveys luxury.

### Eggs Media

While Eggs Media's websites aren't works of art they demonstrate clear adherence to design principles. While the website speeds are held back due to them being made with WordPress, this is not their biggest issue. After looking at their monthly package I discovered that on top of charging a flat price for the website, they charge up to $400 a month for website maintenance. To me, this is a clear attempt to sell overpriced add-ons that business owners don't need.

### Canadian Website Design

A quick look at Canadian Website Design's portfolio will show you that this professional agency and its team of developers are going to create a website that looks like a WordPress theme. You will not get a unique design, you will not get a performant website, and you will pay more than you should.

### Site Dudes

#### https://www.sitedudes.com/

#### ðŸ’° | ðŸŽ¨ | âš¡

If you want the cheapest website possible, buy a WordPress theme and host your website. If you really don't want to touch your website and instead want the cheapest hands-off option possible you might end up with Site Dudes. The websites created by Site Dudes are some of the worst professional websites I have ever seen. From design to security, to lack of mobile responsiveness. They are currently charging $75 dollars a month for websites they created 15 years ago. You can't really beat their price but for that price you are getting some terrible quality.

### Onkyoh Web Designs

#### https://www.onkyohwebdesigns.ca

Your business needs a website with a clean and modern design that looks good on everything from mobile phones to computer screens. This website should load as fast as possible to optimize Google rankings and to capture every visitor's attention. Most of all your business's website shouldn't break the bank and should be taken completely off your hands. This is exactly the type of service I provide with the websites I make.

I make sure you get your money's worth with a high-quality website that you can be proud of to represent your business digitally. The best part? You don't need to worry about the website at all, I handle everything from analytics to hosting, and updates.

**When you work with me you work with a developer dedicated to your business, not a business dedicated to making money.**
